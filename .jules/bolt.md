## 2026-08-20 - Zustand derived state rendering optimization
**Learning:** Returning freshly allocated arrays such as `Object.values(state.approvals)` from a Zustand selector can trigger unnecessary React re-renders and, with React 19/useSyncExternalStore, can contribute to update loops.
**Resolution:** The agency branch selects the stable `approvals` record and derives arrays/counts during render. `useShallow` is also valid when a selector must return derived arrays/objects; prefer the smallest selector that preserves stable equality semantics.
## 2026-08-21 - Zustand Primitive Selector Optimization
**Learning:** Selecting a full object in Zustand just to compute a primitive like `.length` in the component causes unnecessary re-renders.
**Action:** Compute and return the primitive value directly inside the selector.
## 2026-08-22 - Hoisting Static Layout Calculations
**Learning:** Deriving layout arrays and coordinate math inside a component from static constants causes memory allocation/garbage collection on every render loop.
**Action:** Hoist these static calculations outside of the component to instantiate them exactly once.
